This is a collection of code by programmer Aubrey Jay Cook that serves no particular purpose.

The code here is not written with any particular language or features in mind, it may or may not be functional, and any part of it may have no connection with other parts of it.

This repository only serves as a collection of code that is merely written to be written, it is essentially just a pile of garbage, and does not function with any explicit purpose in mind.
